# terraform-apache-jenkins
a project to automate a jenkinsfile using terraform nd using the jenkins pipeline to install apache using terraform

on the infra folder when running the terraform init the backend threw error which i resolved by deleting what was in the bucket using the below command

aws s3 rm s3://lulu-1985-bucket --recursive 
after which i re-run the terraform init

once inside jenkins you go to 
new item - pipeline - ok
Description - check github project - paste the project github url
pipeline - click the drop down and select pipeline script from scm
github path - jenkinsfile
Apply - save

This usually means Terraform is trying to access AWS but canâ€™t authenticate, and itâ€™s not running on an EC2 instance (or if it is, there's no IAM role assigned)

go ahead and create an iam role in ec2 instance
search for IAM - roles - create roles - aws service - service or use roles - select ec2 - next
Administrator access - next
role name(give the role a name - create)

Go back to ec2 - instance - check d instance - action -modify iam role - iam role - select the role created - update
go back to jenkins clck on configure u will c 
This project is parameterized go ahead and apply -save - build
